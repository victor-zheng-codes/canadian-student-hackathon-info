# Canadian Student Hackathon Information
A site to help university and high school students keep up to date with the latest hackathons. 

## There are a few goals of my site:
1. To help students find hackathons to view and contribute to. 
2. Develop skills needed for an ever changing world. 
3. Be the one stop shop for all hackathon resources. 

## Problem Description:
New to tech? What’s a hackathon? What should I be doing? Am I missing out? Which hackathon should I join? 
These are all relevant and important questions for students to ask. 3 years ago, I was asking these questions. I had no clue what a hackathon was, but I was interested in finding out. However, a simple Google search will yield little to no information about the biggest or brightest hackathons. For instance, a google search for “hackathon” will have a hit leading to an Eventbrite page regarding “Tech Startup Business Hackathon”. This makes it very hard for a busy student to even grasp what a hackathon is – let alone participate. This means that many students who might not be familiar with tech will not actually be able to participate. In my experience talking with hackathon organizers, attracting beginners is one of the hardest challenges in organizing. 

Marginalized and those without prior experience won’t be able to experience hackathons. This is a detriment to not only them, but is also a failure of the system. I hope that by maintaining my project, I will be able to help new students gain knowledge of hackathons. 



Project started as a small idea during UofT Hacks 2022.
